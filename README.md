Elbereth
========

This is my Elbereth theme/rc.lua.

Features:
-Tolkien themed rc.lua
-Vi-like hjkl client switching
-Modal conky (switch between top and taskwarrior)
-Fast suspend/hibernate
-Keyboard and mouse-based volume control
-Will cause non-blind monsters to flee

Requirements:
Awesome window manager 3.4.11
Tengwar Formal font (http://tengwarformal.limes.com.pl/)
blingbling (my screenshots are with my fork, but it should work with the original)

Also uses:
conky, taskwarrior, mpd, etc...


Installation:
Copy the "elbereth" theme directory to /usr/share/awesome/themes (or wherever you store your themes)
Copy rc.lua to ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua


Other Notes:
I use the +event tag in taskwarrior to mark events but it should be simple to hack this however you want.

License:
The rc.lua file is liscensed under GPL v 2.0
I have no connection with the Tolkien Estate but belive that believe that any copyrighted material is used under the Fair Use portion of United States copyright law.

TODO:
Document controls. Right now you can find them in the rc.lua.
