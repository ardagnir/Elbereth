Elbereth
========

This is my Elbereth theme/rc.lua.

<b>Features</b>:<br>
-Tolkien themed rc.lua<br>
-Vi-like hjkl client switching<br>
-Modal conky (switch between top and taskwarrior)<br>
-Fast suspend/hibernate<br>
-Keyboard and mouse-based volume control<br>
-Will cause non-blind monsters to flee

<b>Requirements</b>:<br>
Awesome window manager 3.4.11<br>
Tengwar Formal font (http://tengwarformal.limes.com.pl/)<br>
blingbling (my screenshots are with my fork, but it should work with the original)

<b>Also uses</b>:<br>
conky, taskwarrior, mpd, etc...


<b>Installation</b>:<br>
Copy the "elbereth" theme directory to /usr/share/awesome/themes (or wherever you store your themes)<br>
Copy rc.lua to ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua


<b>Other Notes</b>:<br>
I use the +event tag in taskwarrior to mark events but it should be simple to hack this however you want.

<b>License</b>:<br>
The rc.lua file is liscensed under GPL v 2.0<br>
I have no connection with the Tolkien Estate but belive that believe that any copyrighted material is used under the Fair Use portion of United States copyright law.

<b>TODO</b>:<br>
Document controls. Right now you can find them in the rc.lua.
